This **PowerApps Component Framework (PCF)** control enables users to visualize records in a **Kanban** view.

## 📌 Features
- Dynamic Kanban board view.
- Dynamically shows columns based on the selected view.
- Supports **business process flows** and **Choice** columns.
- Drag-and-drop functionality.
- Lookup column support.
- Toast notifications for value updates.
- 
## 🚀 Usage

After adding the control, configure the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Business Process Flow Step Order** | Adds more control to order of business process flow steps. |
| **Notification Position** | Sets the position of toast messages. |
| **Success Message** | Message displayed when a record is successfully moved or updated. Use `{columnName}` as a placeholder to dynamically insert the column name. |
| **View By Label** | Label text for the *View by* dropdown in the Kanban. If not set, the default label is **View by**. |
| **Saving Text** | Text shown while data is being saved. |
| **Empty Column Text** | Text shown when a Kanban column has no records. |


## View Types

The dropdown automatically adjusts to the associated dataset view. If a new **Choice** column is added, the control updates dynamically to reflect the new values.
Also, if the table has any active BPFs, they will appear as an option in the "View type" dropdown.

- Column Order: Card columns are reordered based on the dataset view’s column order.

⚠ **Note:** If the **Status Reason** column is included in the view, only **active statuses** will be displayed.

## Card Behavior

The columns displayed on each card are **not hardcoded**. They are dynamically pulled from the dataset view, ensuring real-time adaptation to the dataset’s structure.

You can still use standard **Edit Columns** and **Edit Filters** functionality.

- **Edit filters or search** will normally affect the items that appear in the kanban.
- **Edit Columns** can be used to add, remove or sort the columns that appear on the card as well as the "View Type" dropdown.

### 🔹 Additional Notes
- Lookup columns remain accessible from the card.
- Dragging a card to another column triggers a toast message indicating **success** or **failure** of the update.
- If the selected **View Type** is linked to a **business process flow**, the record will **not** move directly to another column. Instead, a popup will open, requiring a **manual stage update**.


### Example - Business Process Flow Step Order (JSON string)
   ```sh
   [{"id":"Develop","order":2},{"id":"Propose","order":1},{"id":"Close","order":0}]
   ```
You can set the JSON data in the input using the old interface
